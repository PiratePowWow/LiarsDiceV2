Rules O' Liar's Dice

The object of Liar's Dice is to bet on the total number of a particular die in the game
 without getting called a liar only to find you bet too high.

When the game starts, roll your dice
Once all players have rolled their dice, play begins with the player in seat 1(or the player who lost the previous game)
Play then proceeds in order of seat number

You can only view your own dice

Your Turn:
	You may do one of two things on your turn:

	1. Raise stakes
		-If you think the previous player's bet is likely to be true

	2. Call the previous player a liar
		-If you think the previous player's bet is unreasonable

Raising Stakes:
	A stake is the number of dice of a denomination, for instance: Four fours, or Two fives

	Valid Raise:

	1. The number of dice in the stake can never decrease from the current stake

	2. The type of die being bet on CAN decrease, but if it does the number of dice in the stake MUST increase

	3. If you wish to increase the type of die being bet on, the number of dice does not have to increase

Call A Liar:
	If you do not think the previous player's bet is reasonable, you can call them a liar and find out

	If there aren't as many dice on the table as the previous player bet they lose, if there are then you lose
